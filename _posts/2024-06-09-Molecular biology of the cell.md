## Large Collections of Engineered Mutations Provide a Tool for Examining the Function of Every Gene in an Organism

unique “bar-code”?

Using viral expression vectors, a large library of different guide RNAs can be expressed in a cell population, such that only one guide RNA is expressed in each cell, along with Cas9.

The technique introduces into a cell or organism a double-strand RNA molecule whose nucleotide sequence matches that of part of the gene to be inactivated.?

Often this is a specially designed RNA that can fold back on itself and, through base-pairing, produce a double-strand region that is recognized by the RNAi machinery.?

For unknown reasons, RNAi does not efficiently inactivate all genes.(interesting)

certain tissues may be resistant to the action of RNAi (for example, neurons in nematodes).

One strategy to avoid such problems is to use multiple small RNA molecules matched to different regions of the same gene.(如何实现?)

Ultimately, the results of any RNAi experiment must be viewed as a strong clue to, but not necessarily a proof of, normal gene function.(定性)

cis-regulatory DNA sequences?

The hybridization conditions can be set so that even a single mismatch will prevent hybridization to “near-miss” sequences.应用解决脱靶问题?
